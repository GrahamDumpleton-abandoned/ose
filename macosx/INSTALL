If you are happy with the default deployment options used when a project
builder target is built, simply run:

  pbxbuild -buildstyle Deployment -target OSE install

This will result in "OSE.framework" being created and placed in:

  build/UninstalledProducts

Copy the "OSE.framework" folder to:

  /Library/Frameworks

Note that the library will not be installed so as to include support for
POSIX threads. You would need to change the project builder file to build
that in and you would also need to define the same enabling preprocessor
symbol in any projects which use the installed version.

If you wish to build a loadable module for the Python wrappers which
is dependent on the OSE framework rather than being self contained, run:

  pbxbuild -buildstyle Deployment -target python install

This will result in "python.bundle" being created and placed in:

  build/UninstalledProducts

In the "python.bundle" will be found:

  _osemodule.so

Note that you need to have a version of Python installed which installs
as a MacOS X library framework.

If you want to remove the results of the build, you should run:

  chmod -R u+w build
  rm -rf build

It is a good idea to do this before any build.
