  - It isn't possible to install generated header files unless they are
    being installed into subdirectory in install area with same name as
    makeit subdirectory.

  - Be able to suppress lib.a creation and installation if only
    interested in shlib. Ie., when using Java module.

  - Optimise combine module so that don't have two archives when
    don't have separate pic objects.

  - Look at dependencies when SRCDIRS is used and directory is an
    absolute path.

  - Look at dependencies in workspace when SRCDIRS also used.
