Changes In OSE 8.2
==================

New Features
------------

- Added numClients() member function to OTC_EPListener for querying the
  number of currently active client connections established through the
  listener.

- Added to OTC_HttpDaemon the member functions suspendListening(),
  resumeListening(), addObserver(), removeObserver(), observersExist() and
  numClients(). These all redirect the call to the contained listener
  object. Together they can be used to monitor client connections as they
  are established and subsequently shutdown. If the number of actual client
  connections reaches some threshold set by user code, the user code could
  suspend the listener preventing it from accepting more connections until
  requests from existing clients have been completed and the number of
  client connections drops back below some threshold. The type of event
  generated and pushed to the registered observers will be the same as
  that generated by OTC_EPListener, specification the OTCEV_Connection
  event class.

- Added to OTC_JobQueue the member functions numPriorityJobs(),
  numStandardJobs() and numIdleJobs() for the purposes of getting back
  some basic information about how many jobs are waiting to be executed.
  The instance OTC_JobQueue in use by the dispatcher is accessible using
  OTC_Dispatcher::queue().
