This directory contains a makefile for building and running the test
programs that are included in the OSE source code. You will not actually
find the test programs in this directory though, they are located in the
subdirectories of "lib/OTC" along with the actual library code. All test
programs have a name beginning with an underscore.

If you want to compile and run the test programs, you should run in this
directory the command:

    makeit check

When you are happy that the tests worked okay, you can reclaim the space
used by running:

    makeit clean

Note that the tests will use the installed version of OSE, so you must have
set your PATH correctly.

You may see slight differences in what was expected due in part to how your
compiler handles streams output for certain types. You will also see slight
differences depending on whether or not your compiler supports exceptions.
