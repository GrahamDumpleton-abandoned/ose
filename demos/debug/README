This directory contains some examples of using the logging system.

  logger.py

    Basic use of the logging system.

  logmon-service.py

    Example of a log monitoring service. The idea is that any services
    would log debug messages using the logger on a channel with name
    equivalent to the agent identity for that service surrounded by "()".
    The channel name is enclosed in brackets so that it uses a hidden
    channel and as such the messages wouldn't normally been seen on the
    standard error output or in log files.

    Remote clients would subscribe to the log monitor in the same process
    as the service of interest, using a subject equivalent to agent
    identity of the service of interest. The log monitoring service
    monitors subscriptions and only at the point of getting a subscription
    starts intercepting the log messages for the appropriate service and
    publishing them such that the remote client will be able to see them.

    The "spyon" GUI can be used to determine the agent identity for a
    particular service, with the GUI then used to subscribe to the log
    monitor in the same process to monitor the debug messages. Overall,
    this technique can be used as a useful debugging tool while getting
    programs to work. When the "spyon" GUI is developed further, it may
    be extended to automatically provide this facility using a single
    press of a button.
