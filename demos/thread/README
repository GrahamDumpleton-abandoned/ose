Description of programs as follows:

  simple-threading

    Use low level thread pool to create threads and then generate number of
    events for them to process. Program will terminate when all events
    processed.

  agent-threading

    Shows how threads can be introduced into existing event system model.
    Program will shutdown on a CTRL-C.

Both programs will compile and run successfully with or without thread
support enabled in OSE. When threading is enabled, processing obviously
can run in parallel whereas without it, it will be sequential.
