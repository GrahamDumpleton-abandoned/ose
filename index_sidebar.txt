Note that the OSE package is in the process of being reorganised, with
makeit being extracted out of OSE and made into a separate package in its
own right. In the process of doing this, the documentation for makeit, the
C++ class libraries and the Python wrappers are being updated and moved
here to this web site. While this is being done, older documentation can
still be found on the SourceForge_ web site.
