OSE
===

OSE is a generic application framework suitable for constructing general
purpose applications, multiprocess distributed systems and web based
services using the C++ and Python programming languages.

As well as providing a general purpose C++ class library, the package
provides support for developing applications in both the C++ and Python
programming languages using an event driven system model of programming.
This can extend from simple standalone applications up to distributed
service agent based systems incorporating presence, and communicating using
request/reply and publish/subscribe messaging mechanisms.

Interfacing to applications can be carried out by constructing web based
interfaces using an included HTTP servlet framework, by interfacing from
mod_python using the Python programming language, or by using any other
programming language which supports an XML-RPC client.
