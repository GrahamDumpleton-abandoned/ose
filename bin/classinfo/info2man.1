.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(COinfo2man\fP program generates a standard style UNIX manual page
from the classinfo file specified. The names of the generated files
will correspond to the names of the classes the classinfo file
describes.

By default, manual pages for nested classes will not be output.
To generated manual pages for nested classes specify the "-nested"
option.

By default the suffix appended to the manual pages will be ".3". The
extension appended to the manual pages can be changed by specifying
the "-ext" option.

By default the section name output in the header of the manual
page will be "C++ Reference Manual". This can be overridden by
providing a "LIBRARY" tag in the original source file, in which
case "LIB Reference Manual" will be generated where "LIB" is the
value associated with the "LIBRARY" tag. Alternatively, the complete
string can be replaced by specifying the "-section" option.

By default the package name output in the footer of the manual page
will be "C++ Library". This can be overridden by providing a "LIBRARY"
tag in the original source file, in which case "LIB Library" will be
generated where "LIB" is the value associated with the "LIBRARY" tag.
Alternatively, the complete string can be replaced by specifying the
"-package" option.

By default, any manual pages produced will be generated into the
current directory, regardless of where the classinfo input file
is located. To have generated files output to an alternate directory
use the "-output" option.

.SH "NOTES"
Although reference to generating manual pages for only classes is
mentioned, manual pages for structs, unions and templates are
also generated. Further, if the syntax for standalone manual
pages has been used, then manual pages will be generated for that
also
