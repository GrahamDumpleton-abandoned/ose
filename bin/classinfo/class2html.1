.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \f(COclass2html\fP program generates a HTML style manual page from
an input file. The names of the generated files will correspond to the
names of the classes the classinfo file describes. The \f(COclass2html\fP
program achieves this by running \f(COclass2info\fP on the input file and
then running \f(COinfo2html\fP on the generated classinfo file. Options to
this program are simply passed onto \f(COinfo2html\fP.

By default, manual pages for nested classes will not be output.
To generated manual pages for nested classes specify the "-nested"
option.

By default the suffix appended to the manual pages will be ".html". The
extension appended to the manual pages can be changed by specifying
the "-ext" option.

By default, no cross references are inserted into generated file.
Cross references can be generated by supplying "-link" with the
argument being a glob style pattern of the files which can be linked
to. Note that the files must exist, so this program might need to
be run twice, the first time to generate the files, the second
time so that links can be put in.

.SH "NOTES"
Although reference to generating manual pages for only classes is
mentioned, manual pages for structs, unions and templates are
also generated. Further, if the syntax for standalone manual
pages has been used, then manual pages will be generated for that
also
